That pretty much sums up my normal day except I don't wear glasses and I can totally keep a plant alive (atleast I think so)!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on speech recognition and accent conversion. 
- ðŸŒ± I have been learning to implement DSP algorithms on C and C++. 
- ðŸ˜„ Right now I am watching The West Wing and Criminal Minds. 

- And this is still under construction.
