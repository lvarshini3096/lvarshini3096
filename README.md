That pretty much sums up my normal day except I don't wear glasses and I can totally keep a plant alive (atleast I think so)!

- ðŸ”­ I am passionate about all things Audio and Speech AI.
- ðŸŒ± I have been trying to keep up with the latest in the Generative AI space and learning Cloud Services. 
- ðŸ˜„ Right now I am watching The Newsroom and The Middle. 

- And this is still under construction.
